This is a replication study of “Newspapers in Times of Low Advertising Revenues” by Charles Angelucci and Julia Cagé, 2019. Using a difference in difference method, a data set on the local and national newspapers in France from 1960 to 1974 will be analyzed to find the effects the introduction of television advertisements had on newspapers. The control group will be local newspapers and the treatment group will be national newspapers. A linear regression model will estimate the variables of interest of national newspapers compared to local newspapers after the introduction of television advertisements. The results of this show that there is a drastic decrease in revenue from both advertising and sales during this time period. This in turn caused newspaper companies to drop in both number of journalists and quality since they did not have enough funds. Newspapers also experienced a change in readership as more uneducated and people with trade occupations started to read whereas more educated and white collared people stopped. The overall findings of this replication study are almost identical to those found by Angelucci and Cagé.
